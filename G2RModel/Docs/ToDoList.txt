Ged2Reg Toto List

Major features

1. Option to list other events

		groups: residences, dated events, undated facts, none, user (numbered)
2. Ancestor report option
3. Outline report option

Medium features

1. Divorces and separation events should be included wherever marriages are listed.
2. It would be nice to be able to copy complicated options, e.g. title rewriters, between settins sets.


Small features

1. open to open file after creating it (?: dubious portability / availablility in .net5)
2. add name of settings set to status line as reminder when on other settings tabs
3. warn user if a name was typed on Manage Settings, but nothing was done with it
4. remember which settings set was last used.


Quirks

1. Docx, end notes: 
	appear after indexes instead of before
	use roman numerals except in inline repeats


Bugs - Open

1. In docx, inline repeated references are not superscipts.
2. In odt, repeated runs with the same file name accumulate content instead of replacing it.
